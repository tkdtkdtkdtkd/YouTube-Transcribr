Video: Revealing THIS Distribution Strategy I'm Using For My SaaS (85k+ Users Later)
Of course. Here is a detailed breakdown of Benji's distribution strategy for his B2B SaaS, Dora AI, followed
by a clear set of learnings and actionable takeaways.
### Detailed Points from the Text
#### **Part 1: Context and Foundation**
* **Founder:** Benji, founder of Boulevard Legacy LLC (a consumer app studio that scaled to 85,000
users and six-figure revenue). He is now pivoting entirely to his new startup, Dora AI.
* **Product:** Dora AI, a B2B software application.
* **Core Value Proposition:** It helps businesses rank on AI search engines (like ChatGPT, Perplexity)
and traditional search engines (Google). It automates the entire SEO process, allowing a business owner
to "optimize your site on autopilot with a click of a button."
* **Origin:** The software is a productized version of a service that yielded great results, incentivizing
him to turn it into a scalable solution.
#### **Part 2: The Core Philosophy - Why Distribution is King**
* **The 2025 Startup Landscape:** Benji believes that in the current era, a startup's success is almost
entirely dependent on **distribution**, not technology.
* **Diminishing Technical Moat:** The rise of low-code/no-code tools and AI makes building software
easier and faster than ever, eroding the competitive advantage of complex technology.
* **Market Saturation:** Because building is easier, the startup space is becoming more saturated,
making it harder to stand out.
* **Shift to B2B:** He is pursuing a B2B model as he believes it is more sustainable for his future
compared to his previous consumer app studio.
#### **Part 3: The Three-Pillar Distribution System**
Benji's entire strategy is built on a system he developed after numerous coffee chats with founders and
investors. It is divided into three main pillars:
1. **Inbound:** Attracting organic traffic where leads are already "warm" and familiar with the brand
before they engage.
2. **Outbound:** Proactively reaching out to "cold" leads who are not yet familiar with the product.
3. **Manual:** High-touch, non-scalable activities like networking and one-on-one meetings.
#### **Part 4: Deep Dive into the Inbound Strategy**
This is the most detailed part of his plan, focused on creating a content and lead-generation machine.
* **1. Foundational Channels:**
 * **Dora AI Website:** The central hub, optimized for both traditional SEO and "AI Search Engine
Optimization" (AIO) to drive organic traffic. They are already seeing some ranking success.
 * **Key Social Platforms:** He prioritizes **YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn** because his
Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)—founders and business decision-makers—are most active there.
 * **Supporting Platforms:** Meta (Facebook, Reddit), Medium (for articles and comparisons), and
Instagram.
Transcribrr 
 * **Leveraging Existing Audience:** He will use his current following (20,000 on Instagram, 10,000 on
YouTube) as an initial traffic source.
* **2. YouTube Content Strategy:**
 * **Frequency:** Post one long-form video every 2-3 days.
 * **Process:** Benji records the content, and a dedicated video editing team handles production. The
entire process is systemized using Google Drive and Sheets for scheduling.
 * **Performance Tracking:** He will use **UTM links** in the description of every video. This allows
him to track exactly how many clicks and conversions each specific video generates.
 * **Optimization Goal:** His primary goal is **high conversion rates**, not just high view counts. A
video with fewer views but more paying users is considered more successful.
* **3. The Lead Magnet & Nurturing Funnel (The Core Engine):**
 * **Concept:** Instead of just asking people to buy, offer them free value (a "lead magnet") in
exchange for their email address.
 * **The Two CTAs:** Every piece of content will have two calls-to-action:
 1. **Direct CTA:** A simple link to check out the Dora AI website.
 2. **Indirect/Lead Magnet CTA:** An offer for a free resource (e.g., a guide, checklist) that requires
an email signup.
 * **The Funnel Flow:**
 * **Step 1 (Acquisition):** A user provides their email to get the free resource.
 * **Step 2 (Nurturing):** The user is added to a newsletter and put into an automated email
sequence.
 * **Step 3 (Building Trust):** This sequence sends a series of emails over time, each providing
more free value and building familiarity with the brand.
 * **Step 4 (Conversion):** Each email contains a "soft CTA" that nudges the user towards the Dora
AI website, gradually warming them up for a sale.
 * **Marketing Psychology:** He references the principle that a prospect needs to see a product at
least six times before they purchase. This funnel is designed to create those multiple "impressions."
 * **Cross-Platform Implementation:** This same lead magnet strategy will be used on X and LinkedIn.
He'll create posts offering a free resource and ask users to comment with a specific keyword. An
automation tool will then DM the user the link, funneling them into the same newsletter system.
* **4. The Free Tool Strategy:**
 * **Concept:** Offer a free, standalone tool that provides value and serves as a natural entry point to
the paid product.
 * **Inspiration:** He cites **Sticker Mule's** free background remover, which attracts massive traffic
and effectively upsells users on their core sticker/magnet products.
 * **Dora AI's Version:** They will offer a free tool to test a website's SEO performance and generate a
report.
 * **Funnel Integration:** To get the report, users must sign up with their email, which funnels them
back into the same nurturing sequence described above.
#### **Part 5: Deep Dive into the Outbound Strategy**
This pillar is about actively seeking out customers.
* **1. Paid Advertising:**
 * **Platforms:** He will run **LinkedIn Ads and Google Ads**.
 * **Platform to Avoid:** He plans to avoid **Twitter (X) Ads** based on feedback from other B2B
founders who found them to have a poor return on investment.
Transcribrr 
* **2. Lead Generation & Cold Outreach:**
 * **Lead Scraping:** Using tools like **Phantombuster** and **Apollo.io** to find and collect contact
information for his Ideal Customer Profile.
 * **Email Automation:** Using a tool like **Instantly.ai** (or **Clay**) to send cold emails at scale.
The benefit is using unlimited email accounts to increase the volume of outreach.
 * **The Numbers Game Philosophy:** He acknowledges that even with a bad product or a low
conversion rate, a massive volume of outreach can still lead to success.
* **3. Automated Social DMs:**
 * **Method:** Use bot accounts on LinkedIn and Twitter.
 * **Persona:** The bots will be set up with titles like "Sales Associate at Dora AI."
 * **Action:** These bots will automatically DM potential customers to pitch the product.
#### **Part 6: Deep Dive into the Manual Strategy**
* **Concept:** Embracing Y Combinator's philosophy of "doing things that don't scale."
* **Activities:** Entrepreneurship events, coffee chats with founders/investors, and one-on-one online
meetings with potential clients.
* **Purpose:** Although he dislikes it, he believes this is crucial for deeply understanding customer pain
points, which allows him to build a better, more targeted solution.
#### **Part 7: Target Audience, Early Traction, and Growth Levers**
* **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**
 * **SMBs:** Targeting marketing directors at small-to-medium-sized businesses.
 * **Agencies:** PR agencies, SEO agencies, and AI search agencies.
* **The "White-Label" Agency Strategy:**
 * This is a key go-to-market motion. Dora AI is positioned as a backend software (CRM) that SEO
agencies can use to service *their* clients.
 * **The Win-Win:** An agency might charge its client $10,000 for SEO services while paying Dora AI
only $2,000-$3,000, creating a massive profit margin for the agency and recurring revenue for Dora AI.
 * **Early Validation:** He has already closed **three SEO agency owners** he personally knew,
generating **$5,300 in pre-launch revenue**.
* **Aggressive Referral Program:**
 * To fuel the agency strategy, he offers a **50% commission** on the entire deal volume to agency
owners who refer other agencies. This creates a powerful incentive for word-of-mouth growth.

### Learnings and Actionable Takeaways
Here is a summary of the key strategies and resources mentioned, organized into actionable steps.
#### **A. Core Philosophy & Mindset**
1. **Prioritize Distribution Over Perfecting Tech:** Acknowledge that in a saturated market, your ability
to reach customers is more important than having a small technical edge.
2. **Systemize Everything:** Don't rely on ad-hoc efforts. Build a documented system for content
Transcribrr 
creation, lead generation, and outreach (e.g., using Google Sheets for content schedules).
3. **Embrace "Doing Things That Don't Scale":** Talk to your first users one-on-one. The deep insights
you gain will allow you to build a better product and scale more effectively later.
4. **Leverage Your Personal Brand:** If you have an existing audience (on any platform), use it as your
launchpad to get initial traction and revenue before the official launch.
5. **Quantify Your Value:** Frame your product's benefit in terms of revenue gained or lost. Benji
learned this from Alex Hormozi; showing customers a direct link to their bottom line is a powerful sales
tool.
#### **B. Actionable Inbound Marketing Plan**
1. **Build a Lead Magnet Funnel:**
 * **Create a Freebie:** Develop a high-value resource (PDF guide, checklist, template) that your ideal
customer would want.
 * **Set Up an Email Opt-in:** Use a landing page or form to capture emails in exchange for the
freebie.
 * **Write a Nurture Sequence:** Prepare 5-7 automated emails that provide more value and softly
introduce your product.
 .
2. **Develop a Free Tool:**
 * Identify a small, painful problem your customers face.
 * Build a simple, free web tool to solve it (like Sticker Mule's background remover or Dora AI's SEO
report).
 * Require an email signup to use the tool, funneling users into your newsletter.
3. **Execute a Multi-Platform Content Strategy:**
 * **Identify Your "Big 3" Platforms:** Find where your ICP spends the most time (for Benji, it's
YouTube, LinkedIn, X). Focus 80% of your effort there.
 * **Be Consistent:** Set a realistic posting schedule (e.g., 1 video/week, 3 posts/week) and stick to it.
 * **Track Everything with UTMs:** Add unique UTM parameters to the links you share in your content
to measure which channels and specific posts drive the most traffic and conversions to your site.
#### **C. Actionable Outbound Sales Plan**
1. **Build Your Outreach Stack:**
 * **Lead Scraping:** Use **Apollo.io** or **Phantombuster** to find contacts for your ICP.
 * **Email Automation:** Use **Instantly.ai** or **Clay** to send personalized email sequences at
scale.
2. **Run Targeted Ads:** Start with small budgets on **LinkedIn Ads** and **Google Ads**, focusing on a
narrow audience that perfectly matches your ICP. Avoid platforms not suited for your business model
(like Twitter/X for B2B, per Benji's advice).
3. **Explore Automation (Carefully):** Consider using automated DM tools for LinkedIn or X to increase
reach, but be mindful of platform policies and the risk of sounding spammy.
#### **D. Go-to-Market & Business Strategy**
1. **Target Agencies as a Channel (The "White-Label" Play):** If your product can help agencies serve
their clients better, create a partnership or white-label program. It's an efficient way to acquire many
end-users through a single sale.
2. **Implement an Aggressive Referral Program:** Encourage word-of-mouth by offering a significant
incentive (like Benji's 50% commission). This can turn your early customers into your most effective sales

drive massive traffic and sales for its core product.
* **Community & Networking:**

direct line to potential customers.
